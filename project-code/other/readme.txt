Project 2
by Raymond Cheng
COP3331 Spring2019

This program does use "system("CLS")" for cleaner looks,
which is only supported in Windows as far as I know.
If there're errors indicating something about it,
please use the other version I provided that "//" all the "system("CLS")"
It runs perfectly fine on my desktop with Windows 10.
Not too sure if you wanted the original data files or not,
I'm assuming you don't since one of the requirment was to read it from the fixed location C:\3331\Project2,
so I decided to not include them in this zip folder.
